//this might need to be split into multiple components eventually but
//will contain a running list of each product added to the order 
//will contain quantity
//will have a section that will have the subtotal, tax, and total

//section of buttons at the bottom of this section with payment methods (cash card applepay whatever)

//will maybe add ability to split a check
//will maybe add ability to add order to a table
//will maybe add ability to send order (would generate a small text document of the order + ingredients for the kitchen)
